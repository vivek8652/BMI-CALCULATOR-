A BMI calculator (Body Mass Index calculator) is a tool used to estimate a person's body fat based on their height and weight. The BMI value helps determine whether someone is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. It's commonly used as a general health indicator, though it doesn't directly measure body fat percentage.
